We can load waypoints from a file using the mavwp command, launched using the following format
rosrun mavros mavwp load <waypoint file>
There is an example waypoint file at /home/$USER/local_ws/waypoints.txt
The format for waypoint files is as follows. Note that each section is separated by a tab \t, and that a newline separates each command. The header only needs to be on the first line:
QGC WPL <VERSION>
<INDEX> <CURRENT WP> <COORD FRAME> <COMMAND> <PARAM1> <PARAM2> <PARAM3> <PARAM4> <PARAM5/X/LONGITUDE> <PARAM6/Y/LATITUDE> <PARAM7/Z/ALTITUDE> <AUTOCONTINUE>
For more command options, see the mavlink docs at https://pixhawk.ethz.ch/mavlink/
Note that not all commands are supported by px4.

Once commands are sent, we need to switch to auto mode and the waypoints will be executed
